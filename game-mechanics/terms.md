## Model Types

#### Hero / Герой

#### Companion / Компаньон
Companions are Heroes those are not part of the players' party.
Sometimes they act under players' control, sometime they are controlled by the gamemaster.

#### Minion / Миньон
Sometimes Heroes are able to take control of the Adversaries, or even summon their own.
These models are called minions. They act exactly as adversaries, with a few exceptions:
1. Minions act under their master's control.
Player should roll for minion's behaviour table at the end of their hero's turn.
2. Minions do not group. Each one acts separately.
3. Adversaries treat all minions as Heroes, unless otherwise stated.
4. Minions are friendly to Heroes and foe to Adversaries.
5. Minions can only act once per turn.
That means, if a minion was activated by the Hero's ability, they will not act at the end of that Hero's turn.

#### Adversary / Противник

#### Heroic Adversary / Героический противник
Heroic Adversaries are the most rare, sometimes even unique enemies Heroes can witness on their way.
Heroic Adversaries cannot be stunned.
In addition, they are immune to the majority of special effects provided by treasures and artifacts

#### Daemons and Undead / Демоны и Нежить
_Daemon_ and _Undead_ are the additional traits applicable for both Heroes and Adversaries.

#### Familiar / Фамильяр
Familiars are neither Heroes nor Adversaries. They remain neutral to the both sides.
Instead, they have a passive gameboard effect.
All models but normal Heroes are free to move through the Familiars (but cannot end their move there).
When the Hero steps onto the space with the Familiar, they immediately ends their move and tries to catch it.
To do so, player and the Gamemaster roll a D6.
If the Gamemaster rolls more, he wins, and the Familiar escapes, applying their Bane effect.
Otherwise, the Hero wins, they apply the Familiar's Boon effect.
At most, this is an active effect, which can be used later in the game.

## Game Effects
#### Nearby / Неподалёку
When any rule or effect refers to something "nearby", it does mean any of these somethings within 3 spaces.

Когда какой-то эффект ссылается на что-либо "неподалёку", имеются в виду любое из этих "что-либ" в пределах 3 клеток.

#### Line of Sight / Линия видимости
You see any space within the current chamber, as well as all nearby spaces.
In the game terms, the model has the Line of Sight to that space.
The very same rules apply to the models on the visible spaces.

In addition, you always have the Line of Sight to all models adjacent to the current chamber, and vice versa. 

## Dungeon Structure / Структура Подземелья
#### Level / Уровень
The term is not recomended as long as it can be understanded as both depth's level and game level.

Этот термин не рекомендуется к использованию, так как его можно трактовать двояко - и как уровень в глубину, и как отдельный игровой уровень.  

#### Tier / Ярус
The value of level's depth. First tier is close enough to the ground, all other are way more deeper.

Номер уровня "в глубину". Первый ярус находится максимально близко к поверхности, все остальные - значительно ниже.

#### Location / Локация
Location is the single game level.

Локация - это один игровой уровень.
