## Core
#### Heroes Resurrection
Grievously wounded heroes are no longer returned to combat when there no enemies on the board -
instead, they can only be resurrected during the **Respite** (see below).

## Attacks
#### Attacks with the Area Range
In addition to normal rules for Area attacks, you always hit the adjacent enemy even they are not in the current segment of chamber. 

## Adversary Phase
### Respite and Ambushes
When no adversaries left on the field at the start of the Adversary Phase, heroes can choose to **Rest**.
If they do not wish to do so, the Gamemaster rolls a dice - on the roll of 7+ (+1 for each level of difficulty) an **Ambush** appears.
However, if they wish to Rest, the special act of **Respite** is triggered.

#### Respite Sequence
1. All grievously wounded heroes are returned to the gameboard.
2. All heroes can be placed wherever they want - on the any free space of the dungeon.
3. All heroes heal all but grievously wounds.
4. If heroes wish, they can pick any found Gold Pieces, or relocate them.

However, such a frivolous actions cannot remain hidden to the dungeon masters - after all these steps are done, the Gamemaster rolls a dice.
If they roll 5+ (+1 for each level of difficulty), then a terrible **Ambush** appears.

### Combat
#### Manual Control
Up to 0 times per location, +2 for each level of difficulty, after the Behaviour Roll is made, Gamemaster can declare that he is changing the behaviour of group to the following:
*"Move an adversary in any direction, then attack with a weapon of your choice."*
In case of any effects preventing group from trigger, Gamemaster decides **after**   87 the adventurers.
Reset this counter after a Respite has been made by the adventurers.

## Gold
Sometimes your Hero will find Gold Pieces - if that happens, either put it to the floor of the current chamber, or put a Gold Piece Marker on your Hero card.
Every Hero can carry up to 2 Gold Pieces without any penalties.
When your Hero picks up a gold piece and they do already have 2 other gold pieces, place it on your Hero card, exactly as per Wound or Stun marker.
Each space can be used for carrying up to 5 gold pieces.

When your Hero suffers a Wound (or Stun), you can either put a Wound (Stun) marker on a free slot of your Hero Card, or drop gold from one dice slot and place Wound (Stun) marker instead.
If you choose second, roll a dice for each Gold Piece dropped - on a roll of 1-2 it rolls away and disappears, otherwise place it near the current chamber - it can be picked up again later by completing the Pick Gold.

These extra gold markers can be transferred between Heroes freely while they are adjacent, but cannot be dropped in any other manner.

## Renown
### Group Renown
The mechanic of gaining renown is slightly changed to balance experience values between the party members.
There is a new special counter placed on the Heroes Renown Tracker.
It is called Group Renown.

Each time Hero gains Renown as a result of killing an adversary, they move the Group Renown instead of their own.
When the Group Renown counter makes a full circle on the Renown Tracker, **all** Heroes gain D3+1 personal Renown.

So, it means, that support Heroes would gain slightly more Renown than normal,
and carry Heroes would gain slightly less Renown than normal.
However, the total amount of Renown gained by party is increased approximately by 20%.
(Per 10 Group Renown, they totally gain 8 to 16 Renown, 12 in average.)

### Sacrifice Renown
Some effects allow heroes to sacrifice their own or group Renown as a cost of cool game bonuses.
This means they move backwards on the Renown Tracker.
However, if they do not have enough Renown - i.e., they are currently stuck at the start of the circle,
they cannot sacrifice renown.

### Renown Reduction
Some effects force heroes to reduce their own or group Renown.
If there isn't enough renown to pay the price, the renown counter is placed at the start of the circle.
