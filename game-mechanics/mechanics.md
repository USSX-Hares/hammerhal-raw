## Attacks
#### Attacks with the Area Range
In addition to normal rules for Area attacks, you always hit the adjacent enemy even they are not in the current segment of chamber. 

## Adversary Phase
#### Manual Control
Up to 0 times per location, +2 for each level of difficulty, after the Behaviour Roll is made, Gamemaster can declare that he is changing the behaviour of group to the following:
*"Move an adversary in any direction, then attack with a weapon of your choice."*
In case of any effects preventing group from trigger, Gamemaster decides **after**   87 the adventurers.
Reset this counter after a Respite has been made by the adventurers.

## Gold
Sometimes your Hero will find Gold Pieces - if that happens, put a Gold Piece Marker on your Hero card.
Every Hero can carry up to 2 Gold Pieces 
When your Hero picks up a gold piece and they do already have 2 other gold pieces, place it on your Hero card, exactly as per Wound or Stun marker.
Each space can be used for carrying up to 5 gold pieces.

When your Hero suffers a Wound (or Stun), you can either put a Wound (Stun) marker on a free slot of your Hero Card, or drop gold from one dice slot and place Wound (Stun) marker instead.
If you choose second, roll a dice for each Gold Piece dropped - on a roll of 1-2 it rolls away and disappears, otherwise place it near the current chamber - it can be picked up again later by completing the Search action.

These extra gold markers can be transferred between Heroes freely while they are adjacent, but cannot be dropped in any other manner.
