## Basic Actions

#### Move (1+)
In addition to the normal rules for moving, Heroes can move through adversaries.
If they do so, make an Agility roll.
Heroes must begin this “jump” on an empty space adjacent to the adversary they want to jump over – on a failure, Hero is stuck on that space and Wounded; on success they continue their move.

Adversaries can move through the Heroes in the very same manner.
In the case of failure, they suffer a Stun marker instead of Wound.

#### Recuperate (1+*)
*Unchanged*

#### Open Portal (1+)
If your Hero is adjacent to a closed portal and there are no enemies nearby, they can open it.
Gamemaster places a new Chamber and tells what have happened.

#### Search (4+)
If there are no enemies nearby, and the current chamber contains a Search Marker, remove it.
Then the gamemaster reads the special section about secrets of the current chamber. Usually it contains Gold, but could also contaion a powerful artifacts or hidden events.  

### Pick Gold (3+*)
Collect and put to your Hero card up to 1 Gold Piece that was found or dropped earlier in the current chamber.
You can pick up an additional Gold Piece for each point of dice you spent above 3.
In example, if you spent a dice with value of 5 you then can collect up to 3 Gold Pieces.
